          <p>
            Hi! My name is Laura. I am a 20 year old college student and STEP 
            Intern with Google. I am studying Computer Science &#38 Information 
            Technology at NUI Galway in Ireland. This page will tell you 
            everything you need to know about me, and will also showcase some 
            of my other projects.

            This is a website I made in my second year software development 
            course. It's a dating site where users are matched to each other 
            based on their music preferences!

            This is a personal project, currently on hold so I can focus on my 
            internship. It is going to be a blog where I talk about a whole 
            pile of things, as well as showcase my projects.

            <div id="food" class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('food')" onmouseout="hideText('food')">
                <h3>Food</h3>
                <p>
                    There are too many delicious things out there for me to 
                    decide on just one, but the massaman curry from my 
                    favourite restaurant is definitely up there. I'm also a 
                    huge fan of Japanese dishes like sushi, teriyaki and katsu 
                    curry, though Indian and Italian food is also amazing.

            <div id="sport" class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('sport')" onmouseout="hideText('sport')">
                <h3>Sport</h3>
                <p>
                    Without a doubt, my favourite sport is archery. I joined 
                    my college's archery club in first year, and it didn't 
                    take long for me to fall in love with it. I have my own 
                    bow now, as well as a range set up at home to practise. I 
                    also enjoy GAA, rugby and darts, but more as a spectator 
                    than a player.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="music" class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('music')" onmouseout="hideText('music')">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    I listen to a lot of different genres, so it is really 
                    difficult for me to pick just one! My favourite artist is 
                    probably Hozier, he has an amazing voice and his lyrics 
                    are so poetic. I also like emo, pop-punk, alternative 
                    rock, electroswing and songs from musicals.

            <div id="movie" class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('movie')" onmouseout="hideText('movie')">
                <h3>Movie</h3>
                <p>
                    I don't watch movies very often, but my favourite would be 
                    the film Snatch. The film is incredibly funny, and the way 
                    all of the separate story lines cross and link together is 
                    so cool to see. I have also watched all of the MCU films 
                    multiple times, so it would be unfair if I didn’t mention 
                    them.

            <div id="tv" class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('tv')" onmouseout="hideText('tv')">
                <h3>TV series</h3>
                <p>
                    I do not watch much TV, but I do have a few favourite 
                    shows. Avatar: The Last Airbender and its sequel Legend of 
                    Korra are amazing shows that I watched as a child and 
                    still love now. I also love anime, with some of my 
                    favourites being Full Metal Alchemist, Erased and BNA.

                <h3>Video Game</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a huge fan of Nintendo games and own a Switch. My 
                    favourite series is the Legend of Zelda, and my favourite 
                    Zelda game is Breath of the Wild. I also enjoy Animal 
                    Crossing, and have enjoyed playing some Assassin's 
                    Creed games, though there are not many available for the 
                    Switch.

                <h3>Pastime</h3>
                <p>
                    I absolutely love playing boardgames. I love all kinds of 
                    games, from the classics like Monopoly and Cluedo, to more 
                    obscure games like Betrayal and Nothing Personal. I also 
                    love card games, with my current favourite being the 
                    Japanese game Hanafuda.

                <h3>Subject</h3>
                <p>
                    I absolutely love mathematics, especially Linear Algebra 
                    and Graph Theory. Maths is something that has always come 
                    easily to me, and I love solving difficult problems. In 
                    computer science, my favourite area is Algorithms, as I 
                    like looking at different ways of solving the same problem.

            <div id="animal" class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('animal')" onmouseout="hideText('animal')">
                <h3>Animal</h3>
                <p>
                    Honestly, all animals are adorable, but my favourites have 
                    to be turtles, as they are the cutest thing ever! I'm also 
                    a huge fan of lizards and snakes, as well as birds like 
                    owls and penguins. Furry animals like cats and rabbits are 
                    also cute, but I'm unfortunately allergic to fur.
