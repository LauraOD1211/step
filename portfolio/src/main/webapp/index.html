                a blog where I talk about a whole pile of things, as well as showcase my projects and Swedish notes.</p>

            <div id='food' class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('food')" onmouseout="hideText('food')">
                <h3>Food</h3>
                <p>
                    Honestly, there are too many delicious things out there for me to decide on 
                    just one, but I will say that the massaman curry from my favourite local 
                    restaurant is one of the nicest things I have ever had. I'm also a huge fan 
                    of Japanese dishes like sushi, teriyaki and katsu curry, though Indian and 
                    Italian food is also amazing.

            <div id='sport' class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('sport')" onmouseout="hideText('sport')">
                <h3>Sport</h3>
                <p>
                    Without a doubt, my absolute favourite sport is archery. I joined my 
                    college's archery club when I started in first year, and it didn't take 
                    long for me to fall in love with it. I have my own bow and arrows now,
                    and I have a range set up at home to practise. I also enjoy GAA, rugby 
                    and darts, but more as a spectator than a player.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id='music' class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('music')" onmouseout="hideText('music')">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    I listen to a lot of different genres, so it is really difficult for me to 
                    pick just one! My favourite artist is probably Hozier, he has an amazing 
                    voice and his lyrics are so poetic. I also like emo/pop-punk music (think 
                    Fall Out Boy or My Chemical Romance, as well as more modern artists like 
                    half.alive and IDKHOW), and comedy music (NSP and Danny Gonzales).

            </div>
            <div id='movie' class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('movie')" onmouseout="hideText('movie')">
                <h3>Movie</h3>
                <p>
                    To tell the truth, I don't watch very many movies, but if I had to pick one it 
                    would be the 2000 film Snatch, directed by Guy Richie. The film is incredibly 
                    funny, and the way all of the seperate story lines cross and link together is 
                    so cool to see. I have also watched all of the MCU films multiple times, so 
                    it would be unfair to leave them off this list.

            <div id='tv' class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('tv')" onmouseout="hideText('tv')">
                <h3>TV series</h3>
                <p>
                    Much like movies, I do not watch that much TV, but I do have a few favourites. 
                    Avatar: The Last Airbender and it's sequel Legend of Korra are amazing shows 
                    that I watched as a child and still love now. I also enjoyed the anime Full 
                    Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and more recently I have also watched Erased 
                    and BNA, and I really recommend them.

            <div id='vgame' class="favediv hide" onmouseover="showText('vgame')" onmouseout="hideText('vgame')">
                <h3>Video Game</h3>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy video games, Nintendo games in particular. My favourite series 
                    is the Legend of Zelda, and my favourite Zelda game is Breath of the Wild. 
                    The storyline is super intricate, and the graphics are absolutely beautiful. 
                    I also enjoy Animal Crossing, and have recently started playing some Assassin's 
                    Creed games, though there are not many available for the Nintendo Switch.

                <h3>Pastime</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my favourite things to do is play boardgames. During the college semester, 
                    my friends and I meet weekly to play together. I love all kinds of boardgames, 
                    from the classics like Monopoly and Cluedo, to more obscure games like Betrayal at 
                    House on the Hill and Nothing Personal. This also extends to card games of all 
                    kinds, with my favourite at the minute being the traditional Japanese game 
                    Hanafuda.
